It's difficult to show up at a gym when your remaining willpower is on the wan. Even though you are tired because of your constant lack of stamina, putting on your sports attire in a state of lassitude seems like biting off more than you can chew. So we eschew working out altogether. Positing that kind of behavior as mere indolence is facile; there is more to it than just the ostensible reason, being lazy. 

Good health is what we want to achieve; working out is an obstacle. The bigger the obstacle, the more unlikely we are going to overcome it. The secret to a good habit is not finding the 'best' way; the secret is to 'show up' consistently. Not showing up for a few days may seem innocuous, but you are inadvertently making a habit of 'not showing up'. In the long-run, you will have to inure being chronically tired. 

Atomic Habits proposes to employ a subtle artifice; 'the two-minute rule'. Whatever you are trying to do, just start by doing it for two minutes at first. By making it easier to show up, we are more likely to follow through, ending up with a habit we desired.
